    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A versatile and quick meal made from beaten eggs cooked in a pan,
      typically folded over a filling of your choice, such as cheese,
      vegetables, or meat. It's known for being light, fluffy, and a perfect
      breakfast, brunch, or light dinner.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp water or milk</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tsp butter or oil</li>
      <li>
        1/3 to 1/2 cup filling (e.g., shredded cheese, chopped ham, spinach)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prep Eggs: </strong>
        In a small bowl, beat the eggs with water (or milk), salt, and pepper
        until blended. Have your filling ingredients ready to go.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Heat Pan: </strong>
        Heat butter in a 7 to 10-inch nonstick omelet pan or skillet over
        medium-high heat until hot (butter should melt and sizzle gently).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pour Eggs: </strong>
        Pour the egg mixture into the pan. The edges should set immediately.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cook and Push: </strong>
        As the edges set, gently push the cooked portions from the edges toward
        the center with an inverted turner or spatula. Tilt the pan so the
        uncooked egg can flow underneath. Continue this until the top surface is
        thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Add Filling: </strong>Place your filling on one side of the cooked egg circle.</li>
      <li><strong>Fold and Serve: </strong>
        Fold the omelet in half with the turner. With a quick flip or by
        sliding, invert or gently slide the omelet onto a plate. Serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
